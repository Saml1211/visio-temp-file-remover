# Active Context: Visio Temp File Remover

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on implementing critical security and reliability improvements after the initial integration of the Python CLI and Node.js web application. Recent work has addressed several key areas:

### Security Improvements
- **Command Injection Vulnerability**: Removed `Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell scripts and implemented direct file filtering
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation of file paths, patterns, and user inputs across all components
- **Protected Path Prevention**: Added safeguards to prevent deletion of files in system directories
- **Pattern Filtering**: Implemented validation to ensure only safe file patterns are processed

### Reliability Enhancements
- **Timeout Handling**: Added script execution timeouts to prevent hanging on large operations
- **Error Propagation**: Improved error handling and reporting across component boundaries
- **Validation Checks**: Added pre-execution validation of environment dependencies and scripts
- **Edge Case Handling**: Enhanced handling of invalid inputs, missing files, and edge cases

### Configuration Improvements
- **Environment Support**: Added support for environment-specific configuration files
- **Environment Variables**: Implemented override capability through environment variables
- **Validation**: Enhanced configuration validation with clear error reporting

## Recent Changes

### Key Implementations
1. Removed `Invoke-Expression` from `Scan-VisioTempFiles.ps1` to eliminate command injection vulnerability
2. Added protected path validation in `Remove-VisioTempFiles.ps1` to prevent deletion of system files
3. Implemented timeout handling in both CLI and web application
4. Added environment-specific configuration support (`config.[environment].json`)
5. Added health endpoint to the web application for monitoring
6. Enhanced input validation across all components
7. Added file pattern safety validation

### Active Decisions

| Decision | Status | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Use of shared PowerShell scripts | Implemented | Provides consistent behavior and reduces code duplication |
| Migration from `Invoke-Expression` to direct file operations | Implemented | Critical security improvement to prevent command injection |
| Environment-specific configuration | Implemented | Enhances flexibility for different deployment scenarios |
| Protected path validation | Implemented | Prevents accidental deletion of system files |
| Pattern safety validation | Implemented | Ensures only legitimate Visio temp files are processed |

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities
1. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation for CLI and web interfaces
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement basic test suite for critical functionality
3. **Deployment**: Create standardized deployment process for enterprise environments
4. **Logging**: Enhance logging for better diagnostics and audit trail

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Python Core Migration**: Begin planning migration from PowerShell to Python for core file operations
2. **UI Improvements**: Enhance web interface with better file visualization and filtering
3. **Batch Operations**: Support for scheduled/batched file cleanup operations
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Long-term Vision
1. **Cross-platform Support**: Eliminate PowerShell dependency to support non-Windows environments
2. **Additional File Types**: Expand to support other temporary/backup file patterns
3. **Integration**: Support integration with document management systems
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights and trends on temporary file creation and cleanup

## Open Questions & Considerations

1. How should the system handle very large directories with thousands of files?
2. What is the optimal balance between security and usability for file operations?
3. Should file pattern detection be hardcoded or configurable by users?
4. How can we support cross-platform operation while maintaining performance?
5. What telemetry would be useful for understanding usage patterns and improving the tool?

## Current Blockers

1. PowerShell dependency creates Windows-only limitation
2. Performance degradation on network shares with high latency
3. Limited automated testing coverage for critical paths
4. No formal security review process in place
