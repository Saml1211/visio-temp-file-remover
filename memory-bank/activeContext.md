# Active Context: Visio Temp File Remover

## Current Work Focus

The project has recently completed a significant **Web User Interface Overhaul**. This involved extensive styling improvements, enhanced logging for the Node.js backend, and structural updates to the HTML for better usability, responsiveness, and dark mode support.

This follows earlier work on CLI User Experience Improvements, security enhancements, and reliability fixes.

### Latest Web UI Enhancements (Latest Session)
- **Visual Hierarchy & Styling**: Comprehensive CSS refactoring for improved layout, spacing, typography, and color consistency across light and dark modes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced styling for buttons, toggle switches, and form inputs for a more polished feel.
- **Responsiveness**: Improved adaptability of the UI to various screen sizes.
- **Backend Logging**: Integrated `chalk` into the `web-ui/app.js` for colored and structured terminal output, aiding development and debugging.
- **HTML Structure**: Updated `web-ui/views/index.html` for better semantics, accessibility (`aria-label` for toggles), and to align with new CSS.

### Previous CLI UX Improvements
- **UI Streamlining**: Removed redundant informational content.
- **Consolidated Status Messages**: Eliminated duplicate messages.
- **Help Menu Optimization**: Repositioned help.
- **File Detection Fixes**: Resolved JSON parsing issues.
- **Clean Startup Flow**: Streamlined initial experience.

### Previous Security & Reliability (Summary)
- Removed `Invoke-Expression`, enhanced input validation, added protected path prevention, implemented script execution timeouts, and improved error handling.

## Recent Changes

### Web UI Overhaul (Latest Session)
1. **CSS Refactor**: Applied new styles to `web-ui/public/styles.css` covering layout, typography, colors, dark mode, interactive elements (buttons, toggles), and responsiveness.
2. **HTML Updates**: Modified `web-ui/views/index.html` to use new CSS classes, improve toggle switch implementation, and add ARIA labels.
3. **Node.js Logger**: Integrated `chalk` into `web-ui/app.js` for enhanced server-side logging.
4. **Dependency Update**: Added `chalk` to `web-ui/package.json`.

### Key Implementations (Previous Work - CLI, Security, Config)
- Summarized above; details in previous versions of this document.

## Active Decisions

| Decision | Status | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Use of shared PowerShell scripts | Implemented | Consistent behavior, code reuse. |
| Migration from `Invoke-Expression` | Implemented | Critical security improvement. |
| Environment-specific configuration | Implemented | Flexibility. |
| Protected path validation | Implemented | Safety. |
| Pattern safety validation | Implemented | Security. |
| CLI UX streamlining | Completed | Cleaner CLI user experience. |
| Web UI Visual & Logging Overhaul | ✅ **Just Completed** | Modernized web interface, improved developer experience for `web-ui` backend. |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Await User Direction**: The current phase of web UI visual enhancements is complete. Awaiting next set of tasks or priorities from the user.
2. **Testing**: Verify the web UI improvements work correctly across different browsers and devices, and ensure no regressions were introduced.
3. **Documentation Update**: Update web UI documentation/screenshots to reflect the new interface, if applicable.

### Short-term Priorities (General Project)
1. **Documentation**: Create/update comprehensive user documentation for both CLI and web interfaces.
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement/expand test suites (Pester for PS, Jest/Mocha for Node, PyTest for Python).
3. **Deployment**: Standardize deployment process.

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Python Core Migration**: Plan migration from PowerShell to Python for core logic.
2. **Further UI/UX Refinements**: Based on user feedback.

### Long-term Vision
1. **Cross-platform Support**: Address PowerShell dependency.
2. **Additional File Types**: Expand supported temp/backup files.

## Open Questions & Considerations

1. How should the system handle very large directories (performance, UI display)?
2. Optimal balance between security and usability for file operations?
3. Should file pattern detection be hardcoded or user-configurable?
4. Future of PowerShell vs. Python for core logic?

## Current Status

- ✅ **Web UI**: Significantly improved visual appeal, responsiveness, dark mode, and usability.
- ✅ **Web UI Backend Logging**: Enhanced with colors and structure.
- ✅ **CLI Tool**: Stable with clean UI, robust file operations, and security measures.

The project is in a good state, with both interfaces having received significant recent improvements.

## Current Blockers (General Project)

1. PowerShell dependency limits cross-platform capability.
2. Performance on network shares can be slow.
3. Automated test coverage could be more comprehensive
