# Progress: Visio Temp File Remover

## Current Status

The project is in a **stable, functional state** with both CLI and web interfaces operational. Recent security and reliability improvements have significantly enhanced the robustness and safety of the application.

### Completion Status by Component

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PowerShell Scripts | ✅ 95% | Core functionality complete, security improvements implemented |
| Python CLI | ✅ 90% | Functionally complete, needs additional error handling |
| Node.js Web App | ✅ 90% | Core functionality working, UI could be enhanced |
| Configuration System | ✅ 100% | Environment-specific configuration fully implemented |
| Security Hardening | ✅ 80% | Major vulnerabilities addressed, needs formal security review |
| Documentation | ⚠️ 30% | Basic readme exists, needs comprehensive documentation |
| Testing | ⚠️ 20% | Manual testing only, automated testing needed |

## What Works

### Core Features
- ✅ **File Scanning**: Reliably identifies Visio temporary files in specified directories
- ✅ **File Selection**: Both interfaces allow selection of files for deletion
- ✅ **Secure Deletion**: Validates files before deletion, protects system directories
- ✅ **Configuration**: Shared configuration with environment-specific overrides

### Technical Implementations
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Removal of command injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation across all components
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Improved error propagation and user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Timeouts**: Handling of script execution timeouts to prevent hanging
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Health endpoint for web application monitoring

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. 🔲 **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - User guides for both interfaces
   - Administrator documentation for deployment
   - Developer documentation for maintenance

2. 🔲 **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for PowerShell scripts
   - Integration tests for CLI and web interfaces
   - End-to-end workflow tests

3. 🔲 **Enhanced Logging**
   - Structured logging format
   - Log rotation and management
   - Audit logging for file operations

### Medium Priority
1. 🔲 **UI Enhancements**
   - Improved file visualization in web interface
   - Sorting and filtering capabilities
   - Progress indicators for large operations

2. 🔲 **Performance Optimizations**
   - Efficient handling of very large directories
   - Caching for repeated scan operations
   - Parallel processing for large file sets

3. 🔲 **Deployment Tooling**
   - Installer/package creation
   - Configuration management
   - Uninstallation support

### Low Priority
1. 🔲 **Cross-Platform Support Planning**
   - Feasibility study for Python-based core
   - Platform abstraction layer design
   - Migration path planning

2. 🔲 **Additional File Type Support**
   - Support for other application temporary files
   - Custom pattern configuration
   - Pattern detection tuning

## Known Issues

### Security
1. ⚠️ **Process Execution**: Using subprocess for PowerShell execution still presents some risk
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive input validation implemented
   - **Future**: Move core logic to Python to eliminate PowerShell dependency

2. ⚠️ **Windows-Only Protection**: System directory protection assumes Windows paths
   - **Impact**: Low (application is Windows-only)
   - **Future**: Implement platform-agnostic path validation

### Performance
1. ⚠️ **Large Directory Scanning**: Performance degradation with very large directories
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects user experience)
   - **Mitigation**: Timeout handling implemented, but UI may become unresponsive

2. ⚠️ **Network Path Performance**: Slow performance with network shares
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects common use case)
   - **Future**: Implement progress indicators and background processing

### Reliability
1. ⚠️ **Error Handling Edge Cases**: Some complex error conditions may not be handled gracefully
   - **Impact**: Low (rare conditions)
   - **Future**: Comprehensive error catalog and handling strategy

2. ⚠️ **No Automated Testing**: Reliance on manual testing may allow regressions
   - **Impact**: High (affects stability)
   - **Priority**: Implement automated testing framework

## Recent Wins
1. 🏆 Integration of previously separate CLI and web tools into a unified codebase
2. 🏆 Elimination of command injection vulnerability in PowerShell scripts
3. 🏆 Implementation of comprehensive input validation at all levels
4. 🏆 Addition of environment-specific configuration support
5. 🏆 Implementation of health check endpoint for monitoring

## Next Milestone: Production Readiness
The next major milestone is achieving production readiness with:
1. Comprehensive documentation
2. Basic automated testing
3. Enhanced logging
4. Security review completion

**Target Date**: Within next 2-3 weeks
