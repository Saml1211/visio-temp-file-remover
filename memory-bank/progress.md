## What Works

### Core Features
- ✅ **File Scanning**: Reliably identifies Visio temporary files.
- ✅ **File Selection**: Both interfaces allow selection.
- ✅ **Secure Deletion**: Validates files, protects system directories.
- ✅ **Configuration**: Shared configuration with environment overrides.

### Web UI Enhancements (Latest)
- ✅ **Modern Styling**: Polished CSS for layout, spacing, typography, and interactive elements.
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes.
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: Comprehensive dark theme support.
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: `chalk` integration in `web-ui/app.js` for better server-side logs.
- ✅ **Improved HTML Structure**: Semantic and accessible `index.html`.

### CLI Interface Enhancements (Previous)
- ✅ **Clean Startup & Streamlined Flow**: Minimal clutter, direct workflow.
- ✅ **Consolidated & Clear Messages**: No duplicates, clear status.
- ✅ **Proper File Detection**: Robust JSON parsing.
- ✅ **Accessible Help**: Non-intrusive help menu.

### Technical Implementations (General)
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: No `Invoke-Expression`, input validation.
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error management.
- ✅ **Timeouts**: Script execution timeouts.

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. 🔲 **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Update CLI and Web UI documentation (workflows, screenshots).
   - Document new logging and styling patterns.

2. 🔲 **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests (PowerShell, Python, Node.js).
   - Integration tests for CLI and web interfaces.
   - End-to-end workflow tests, including UI interactions.
   - Regression tests for recent UX/UI improvements.

### Medium Priority
1. 🔲 **Enhanced Logging (General)**
   - Consistent structured logging across all components.
   - Log rotation and management strategies.

2. 🔲 **Deployment Tooling**
   - Standardized installers or packages.

### Low Priority
1. 🔲 **Python Core Migration Planning**
   - Feasibility and migration path for replacing PowerShell.

2. 🔲 **Additional File Type Support**
   - Research and planning for configurable patterns.

## Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- None directly from the recent UI build, pending thorough testing.

### Security
1. ⚠️ **Process Execution**: PowerShell dependency still a factor.
   - **Mitigation**: Input validation.
   - **Future**: Python core migration.

### Performance
1. ⚠️ **Large Directory Scanning/Network Paths**: Can be slow.
   - **Mitigation**: Timeouts exist.
   - **Future**: Progress indicators, background processing.

### Reliability
1. ⚠️ **No Automated Testing**: Risk of regressions.
   - **Impact**: High.
   - **Priority**: Implement automated testing.

## Recent Wins
1. 🏆 **Web UI Modernization**: Achieved a polished, responsive, and user-friendly web interface with dark mode.
2. 🏆 **Improved Web Dev Experience**: Enhanced `web-ui/app.js` logging with `chalk`.
3. 🏆 **CLI UX Excellence**: Streamlined CLI provides a clean user experience.
4. 🏆 **File Detection Reliability**: Consistent file discovery in both interfaces.
5. 🏆 **Security Hardening**: `Invoke-Expression` removed, input validation strengthened.

## Next Milestone: Production Readiness
Focus on ensuring the application is robust and well-documented for wider use.
1. Complete automated testing.
2. Finalize all user and developer documentation.
3. Prepare deployment packages/instructions.

**Target Date**: User-defined based on next priorities.

## Quality Assessment
