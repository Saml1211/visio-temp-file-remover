# Web UI and CLI Tool Alignment

## Issue Identified
The web UI's file filtering and searching logic was not matching the robust implementation used in the CLI tool, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential parsing errors.

**UPDATE**: A second issue was found with the deletion functionality - the web UI was using a PowerShell script with overly restrictive validation while the CLI tool used direct PowerShell commands.

## Key Improvements Made

### Backend (app.js) Improvements

1. **Robust JSON Parsing**
   - **Before**: Assumed PowerShell always returns arrays: `const fileArray = Array.isArray(filesData) ? filesData : [];`
   - **After**: Handles both single objects and arrays like CLI tool:
     ```javascript
     if (Array.isArray(resultData)) {
         fileArray = resultData;
     } else if (typeof resultData === 'object' && resultData !== null) {
         fileArray = [resultData]; // Single file found - convert to array
     }
     ```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added empty output validation matching CLI tool
   - Improved stderr handling with proper warning detection
   - Added specific handling for "no files found" scenarios

3. **File Validation**
   - Added filtering to ensure all returned files have required `FullName` property
   - Matches CLI tool's validation approach

4. **Command Construction**
   - Verified PowerShell command construction matches CLI tool exactly
   - Proper escaping and parameter handling

5. **Fixed Deletion Logic** ⭐ NEW
   - **Problem**: Web UI used `Remove-VisioTempFiles.ps1` script with restrictive pattern validation
   - **Solution**: Switched to direct PowerShell commands matching CLI tool approach
   - **Before**: Called external script with complex validation
   - **After**: Uses inline PowerShell foreach loop that directly deletes files:
     ```javascript
     const psCommand = `
     $filesToDelete = @(${quotedPaths.join(',')})
     $results = @{
         deleted = @()
         failed = @()
     }
     
     foreach ($file in $filesToDelete) {
         try {
             if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $file -PathType Leaf) {
                 Remove-Item -LiteralPath $file -Force -ErrorAction Stop
                 $results.deleted += $file
             } else {
                 $results.failed += @{ Path = $file; Error = "File not found" }
             }
         } catch {
             $results.failed += @{ Path = $file; Error = $_.Exception.Message }
         }
     }
     
     $results | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3
     `;
     ```

### Frontend (main.js) Improvements

1. **Robust File Processing**
   - **Before**: Simple mapping with fallback string conversion
   - **After**: Proper validation and filtering matching CLI tool:
     ```javascript
     processedFiles = data.files.filter(file => {
         return file && 
                typeof file === 'object' && 
                file.FullName && 
                file.Name;
     })
     ```

2. **Enhanced Error Messages**
   - Added detailed error reporting including error details
   - Better fallback handling for unexpected data formats

## CLI Tool Logic Patterns Applied

### JSON Parsing Strategy
- Handle both single objects `{}` and arrays `[{}]` from PowerShell
- Validate all file objects have required properties
- Graceful fallback for empty results

### Error Handling
- Check for empty PowerShell output
- Distinguish between warnings and errors in stderr
- Provide specific handling for "no files found" vs actual errors

### File Validation
- Ensure all files have `FullName` property before processing
- Filter out invalid file objects
- Maintain consistent data structure

### Deletion Strategy ⭐ NEW
- Use direct PowerShell commands instead of external scripts
- Simple foreach loop with try/catch for each file
- Return structured JSON with `deleted` and `failed` arrays
- No unnecessary pattern validation during deletion

## Root Cause of Deletion Issue
The `Remove-VisioTempFiles.ps1` script had overly restrictive validation that was rejecting valid files. The CLI tool bypassed this by using direct PowerShell commands, which proved more reliable.

## Testing Considerations
The updated implementation should now handle:
- Single file discovery (PowerShell returns object, not array)
- Multiple file discovery (PowerShell returns array)
- Empty results (PowerShell returns empty array)
- Error conditions (invalid directory, script errors)
- Network/timeout issues
- **File deletion with proper error reporting** ⭐ NEW
- **Mixed success/failure scenarios during deletion** ⭐ NEW

## Result
The web UI now uses the same robust logic patterns as the CLI tool for both scanning AND deletion, ensuring consistent behavior and proper handling of all PowerShell output scenarios.
