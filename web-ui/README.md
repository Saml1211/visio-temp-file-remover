## üîç Overview

The Visio Temp File Remover tool addresses a common problem in Microsoft Visio environments where temporary files (specifically those matching the pattern `~$$*.~vssx`) can cause errors and corruption in Visio shapes and templates. These files are often hidden by default and difficult to locate and remove through normal file management tools.

This application provides an intuitive web interface that allows users to:
1. Scan directories for problematic temporary files
2. Review what will be deleted before taking action
3. Safely remove these files with proper permission handling

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Scanning**: Recursively scans specified directories for Visio temporary files matching `~$$*.~vssx` pattern
- **Hidden File Detection**: Uses PowerShell with proper escaping to find hidden system files that Windows Explorer might not display
- **Preview Before Deletion**: Lists all found files with full paths before any deletion occurs
- **Selective Deletion**: Choose which files to delete rather than removing all matches
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface that requires no technical knowledge to operate
- **Secure Operations**: All file operations are performed server-side with proper error handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- **System Integration**: PowerShell commands for file operations
- **Styling**: Bootstrap for responsive design
- **HTTP Requests**: Fetch API for AJAX operations

## üìã Requirements

- Windows environment (PowerShell required)
- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- Administrative privileges (for accessing system folders)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
